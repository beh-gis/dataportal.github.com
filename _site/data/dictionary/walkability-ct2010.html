<p>The information below is from a BEH data dictionary by James Quinn, Senior GIS Analyst called <a href="https://github.com/beh-gis/beh-gis.github.com/raw/master/projects/data_dictionary/walkability-gis-codebook-2010-tracts-20150112.pdf">GIS Code Book: New York City 2010 Census Tract Walkability Index</a></p>

<h3 id="walkability-index-scale">Walkability Index Scale</h3>
<p>A number of researchers have constructed walkability indices which summarize built environment features believed to promote walking. Although specification details vary, these indices typically include measures of population density, land use, and street network. Our walkability measure was adapted from that employed in recent papers by Frank and colleagues (2005 and 2006), which includes four components: residential population density (density of population per total residential land area), intersection density, an entropy measure of land use based on the distribution of building floor area among six land use types (education, entertainment, single-family residential, multi-family residential, retail, and office), and the retail floor area ratio, or the ratio of retail building floor area to retail land area. All of the Frank components were z-scored and summed, with intersection density receiving a double weight for the Frank Scale, but not for our scale. Our “BEH walkability scale” is documented in a paper by Neckerman and colleagues (2009).</p>

<p>Important Note:
Many of the figures in this document refer to 2010 Census Blocks. This data dictionary is for the 2010 Census Tracts. Figures

<h1 id="walkability-index-scales-city-wide-buffers">Walkability Index Scales: City-­Wide Buffers</h1>
<p>As an alternative to creating a ‘neighborhood walkability index scale’ based solely on the z-scored components within buffers specific to a study cohort, the BEH Working Group has developed a walkability index scale that considers the z-scored components across New York City as a whole.</p>

<p>The issue with creating a walkability index scale using buffer definitions specific to a study cohort is that the cohort may be spatially biased or clustered in a particular neighborhood(s) or parts of the City (e.g., northern Manhattan or the south Bronx). This could dramatically influence the range of z-scored components, and thus not provide a representative scale of walkability for that cohort compared to the walkability of the rest of the City.</p>

<p>The BEH Working Group has tackled this problem by buffering 2010 Census Block centroids (n=38,526) by 1-km radial buffers and then deriving the walkability
components that are later z-scored. In doing so, a more appropriate apples-to-apple comparison of walkability can be made between, say, an address in Staten Island to the rest of the City as whole rather than a cluster of
addresses all within a similar built environment.</p>

<h1 id="averaging-up-to-tract">Averaging up to Tract</h1>
<p>In order to assign each 2010 Census Tract with the city-wide walkability index scale, the walkability index scale values for each Block centroid were simply averaged up to the Tract level. The following variables are the result of that process:</p>

<h4 id="t10key">t10_key</h4>

<h4 id="t10km2-1">t10_km2</h4>

<h4 id="t10lndkm2-1">t10_lndkm2</h4>
<p>Total land area of US 2010 Census Tract geography in km2 (inland water bodies removed).</p>

<h4 id="t10cnt-1">t10_cnt</h4>

<p>BEH Walkability Scale.</p>

<h1 id="walkability-index-scale-variables">Walkability Index Scale Variables</h1>
<p>To date, BEH has created and used two different versions of the Walkability Index Scales, which we refer to here as the “Frank et al. 2006” and BEH scales. The “Frank 2006” includes z-scored variables: residential density, land use mix using 5 land use types, intersection density * 2, and retail area ratio. The BEH scale includes z-scored variables: residential density,
land use mix using 5 land use types, intersection density, retail area ratio, and subway stop density. Note that the BEH scale does not multiply intersection density by 2 and does include subway density.</p>

<h4 id="b1entrpy">b1_entrpy</h4>
<p>Land Use Mix – An entropy measure using the five of the six land use types employed in Frank et al. (2006). Single- and multi-family residential areas were combined because most housing in New York City is multi-family. Parcel-level measures of residential, office, and retail floor area were available from the MapPLUTO (version 04c; October 2004-October 2005) database. We used the MapPLUTO building class codes to identify buildings associated with education (schools) or entertainment (theaters, recreational facilities), and attributed the entire floor area of the identified building to education or
entertainment. The entropy formula used was adapted from Frank et al. (2005), which yielded more plausible results: Land Use Mix = A/ln(N) where: A= –((b1/a)<em>ln(b1/a)+(b2/a)</em>ln(b2/a)+…) and b1 is the building floor area covered by the first land use, b2 is the building floor area covered by the second land use, etc., a is the total floor area across the five land uses, and N is the total number of land uses represented in the census tract. Zero values for b1…b5 were set to .000001 to avoid zero or undefined terms.</p>
